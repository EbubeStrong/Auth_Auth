## 📌 Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up authentication in a frontend application using Vite and connecting it to a backend.

## 🌐 Frontend Setup (Vite + React.js)

### 1️⃣ **Create a New Vite Project**
- Run the following command to create a Vite project:
  ```sh
  npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
  ```
- Navigate into the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd my-app
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### 2️⃣ **Install Required Packages**
- Install Axios for API requests:
  ```sh
  npm install axios react-router-dom
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Set Up Routing**
- Configure React Router to manage authentication-related pages (e.g., Login, Register, Dashboard).

### 4️⃣ **Create Authentication Components**
- Create a **Register Page** where users can input their credentials.
- Create a **Login Page** for user authentication.
- Create a **Dashboard** or protected route that requires authentication.

### 5️⃣ **Connect Frontend to Backend**
- Use Axios to send HTTP requests to the backend authentication endpoints.
- Implement user registration and login by making API calls to the backend.
- Handle authentication responses and store the JWT token in local storage or cookies.

### 6️⃣ **Implement Authentication Flow**
- Store authentication tokens securely.
- Manage user state and redirect authenticated users to the appropriate pages.

### 7️⃣ **Test the Authentication Flow**
- Start the backend server and frontend application.
- Test registration and login forms to ensure users can authenticate successfully.
- Check if tokens are stored and used correctly for protected routes.
