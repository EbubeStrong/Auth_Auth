Authentication & Frontend Connection Guide

üìå Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up authentication in a frontend application using Vite and connecting it to a backend.

üåê Frontend Setup (Vite + React.js)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Vite Project

Run the following command to create a Vite project:

npm create vite@latest my-app --template react

Navigate into the project directory:

cd my-app

Install dependencies:

npm install

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

Install Axios for API requests:

npm install axios react-router-dom

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Routing

Configure React Router to manage authentication-related pages (e.g., Login, Register, Dashboard).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create Authentication Components

Create a Register Page where users can input their credentials.

Create a Login Page for user authentication.

Create a Dashboard or protected route that requires authentication.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Frontend to Backend

Use Axios to send HTTP requests to the backend authentication endpoints.

Implement user registration and login by making API calls to the backend.

Handle authentication responses and store the JWT token in local storage or cookies.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Authentication Flow

Store authentication tokens securely.

Manage user state and redirect authenticated users to the appropriate pages.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Authentication Flow

Start the backend server and frontend application.

Test registration and login forms to ensure users can authenticate successfully.

Check if tokens are stored and used correctly for protected routes.

üéØ Conclusion

This guide outlines the steps required to set up authentication in a Vite frontend.

It ensures seamless communication with the backend for user authentication.

Further enhancements can include password reset, OAuth login, and role-based access control.
